I am writing to complain about a/an + product which I bought in your last week. I am very disappointed with the quality of the product.
As soon as i use the product, i noticed that it have serveral issues. The first issues was that not connect with the Internet. Addtionally, the product is not working properly.
To make mastter worse, when i contact your staff to solve the problem, they are not helpful at all. They just ignore my complaint and not give me any solution.
